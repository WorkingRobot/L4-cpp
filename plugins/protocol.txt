On init:
C2P trade interfaces
C2P Auth.GetUserIdentity
(Client knows what apps it has on its own)

On version check:

Client figures out if its up to date or not

On update:
C2P If app does not have a valid update attached, Update.Open
C2P Update.Start
P2C Update.OnStart, OnProgress, OnPieceUpdate
C2P Update.Pause, Resume
C2P Update.OnFinalize (cannot be paused when finalizing), OnComplete

On sign in, if Auth.GetUser is false:
C2P Auth.Open
C2P Auth.GetFields, Submit until it returns true, until GetFields returns 0 for FieldCount
C2P Auth.Close

On launch:
C2P (TODO)

Future endeavors:
Steam - https://github.com/tpill90/steam-lancache-prefill
Battle.net - https://github.com/tpill90/battlenet-lancache-prefill
These show how to download all the data from the servers and deal with their APIs. I suppose
L4 is just lancache but more vertically integrated?
